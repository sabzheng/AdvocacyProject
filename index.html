      <h2>What is #StopAsianHate?</h2>
      <p>"Stop Asian Hate is a slogan and name for a series of demonstrations, protests, and rallies against violence
        targeting Asians, Asian Americans, and others of Asian descent. They were held across the United States in 2021
        in response to racial discrimination against Asian Americans relating to the COVID-19 pandemic."<br>-Wikipedia
      </p>
      <!--reference: https://www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/community/stop-asian-hate.page-->
      <p>"There has been a significant, troubling increase in anti-Asian hate crimes and bias incidents since the start
        of the pandemic. Beginning in February of 2020, the Commission received a sevenfold increase in reports of
        anti-Asian harassment, discrimination, and violence. It is crucial to note that hate crimes and bias incidents
        have been found to be vastly under-reported so these numbers only reflect reported incidents."<br>-NYC Human

      <h3>Business and Career</h3>
      <p>"Asian American business owners and employees have been experiencing multiple negative impacts amidst the
        pandemic - including disproportionate financial loss and lower rates of government financial assistance. The
        negative effects of these multiple challenges have been further compounded by anti-Asian hate targeting both
        individuals and businesses."<br>-Anti-Asian Racism Business Impacts by Alycia Cheng, Jonathan Ong, Paul Ong

      <h3>Physical and Verbal Threats</h3>
      <p>During the peak of the pandemic, many Asian Americans experienced racially motivated hate crimes involving
        physical violence and harassment</p>
      <p>"According to the STOP AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) HATE Reporting Center, content analysis of 1,843
        incidents yielded the following insights: Virulent animosity towards Chinese Americans, Scapegoating of China
        for the spread of COVID-19, Anti-immigrant nationalism, Parroting of the term ‚ÄúChinese virus‚Äù, Orientalist and
        racist depictions of China such as "dirty" and "diseased""</p>

      <p>"Hate crimes range from 'microaggressions and verbal harassment to assault and other violent hate crimes.'
        Victims of hate crimes are more likely to experience symptoms of psychological distress than victims of non-hate
        crimes. These symptoms include: Anger, Anxiety, Depression, Lower self-esteem, and Post-traumatic
        stress"<br>-Krystal Jagoo </p>

        <p>Many of you have already seen or heard about this act of violence, when eight people were killed at three
          spas in the Atlanta area. Six of the victims were Asian women. They deserve justice and to be known in their
          life and not just in their death. Just yesterday, a Chinese woman also had to defend herself against a racist
          attack here in San Francisco. She was attacked along with another 83-year old Vietnamese man. These are just a
          few of the stories we have heard about. We know that these events are fueled by the same racist, sexist,
          xenophobic system that leaves our people feeling more unsafe than ever before. We stand in solidarity with
          victims, survivors, and families who have suffered loss and pain.</p>
